Topic: Dinosaur diversity and the end Triassic extinction

Scientific Quesiton: Was the explosion in dinosaurian diversity at the end of the Triassic accompanied by contemporaneous drops in diversity losses within other tetrapod communities, or was it instead a response to the lack of diversity within terrestrial ecosystems?

Overview: 201.5 Ma the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) Erupted, issuing over 11,000 square kilometers of magma over the course of 600 million years. This eruptive series coincided with the End Triassic Mass Extinction, the second most deadly in earth's history, with losses in diversity of over 75 percent in some terrestrial ecosystems. Using Paleobiology database, I want to examine the dinosaurian fossil record to determine if the pulse in dinosaur radiation was occuring alongside the extinction of other groups, or if it occurs primarily after the extinction pulse. To do so, I will look at dinosaur localities showing early jurassic forms, and see if the non-dinosaurian groups at the site are representative of latest trassic species or those which survived the mass extinciton. 

database:

The Paleobiology Database is a public database of paleontological data that anyone can use, maintained by an international non-governmental group of paleontologists. You can explore the data online in the Navigator, which lets you filter fossil occurrences by time, space, and taxonomy, and displays their modern and paleogeographic locations; or you can download the data to your own computer to do your own analyses.
